# Restaurant-Orders
Analysis using a MySQL database of restaurant orders and menu items.

## About this project
This project aimed to answer some business questions concerning customer ordering trends at a restaurant. The main questions answered include:

1. What were the least and most ordered items? What categories were they in?
2. What do the highest spend orders look like? Which items did they buy and how much did they spend?
3. Which cuisines should we focus on developing more menu items for based on the data?

Utilizing MySQL queries, the two tables were joined together to discover that chicken tacos are the least ordered items, while hamburgers are the most ordered items, and that the highest spend orders contained a mixture of food types, but all included many orders of Italian dishes.

Based on this information, we can conclude that this restaurant should focus on developing more Italian dishes and items, as these are not only big sellers in terms of price, but also in popularity.
